## My Process

# As of 06/24/22

I've been wanting to create a countdown timer in the style of Pomodoro for a while. However, I also wanted to create a visually pleasing layout, for once. So I've spent the
styling portion of this project with Bootstrap. The layout is simple and the colors of the buttons reflect what the button does. I had a lot of trouble with getting the right
Bootstrap classes to work so, as of right now, my class in the code are pretty messy. The biggest problem is getting the font size of the counter so it looks bigger and more pleasing
to look at. This is a problem I will fix later on, as well as adding the javascipt. I wanted to get the layout down first.

### Built With

- Mobile-first workflow
- Bootstrap
- Javascipt
- Flexbox

### Continued Development

I intend to add the javascipt at a later date once I'm satisfied with the layout. I've only used Bootstrap once before, months ago, so I wanted to get more familiar with it
with this project.
